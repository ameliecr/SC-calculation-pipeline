# Classifiers
We used the same classifiers as Domhof et al. did for an analsysis of parcellation-induced variation of empirical and simulated brain connectomes [1].
They provided links to the publicly available atlas images as well as the code which is used to calculate the exact images used for their analysis here [2]. This is what we also provide in this repository.
